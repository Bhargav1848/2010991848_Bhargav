1.A synchronous function is a function that does not return untill the work is completed or haas failed.
2.Synchronous is single threaded and Asynchronous is multi threaded

        Asynchronous           |             Synchronous
1.Multi threaded               | 1.Single threaded
2.non-blocking approach        | 2. one at a time and only when one is completed

* Async and await are syntatical methods to create non-blocking programms
* Promise object represents the eventual completion(or faliure of a asynchrounous operation and it's resulting value

*Async function always return promise
*Async function always load on the loading of site so we have cover it by another function
